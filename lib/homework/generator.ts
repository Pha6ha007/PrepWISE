${userContext}

Recent conversation:
${conversationSummary}

Create homework that is:
- SMALL and specific (15-30 minutes max)
- ACTIONABLE (clear what to do)
- RELEVANT to what we discussed
- WARM in tone (not clinical or demanding)
- ONE clear task (not multiple tasks)

Categories:
- reflection: journaling, self-reflection, thinking exercises
- action: doing something in real life (e.g., call someone, try new activity)
- mindfulness: breathing, meditation, grounding exercises
- social: reaching out, spending time with others
- creative: drawing, writing, music, creative expression

Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):
{
  "title": "5-10 word title",
  "description": "2-3 sentence description in warm, supportive tone",
  "category": "one of: reflection, action, mindfulness, social, creative"
}

Examples:
{
  "title": "Write a letter to your younger self",
  "description": "Take 20 minutes to write a letter to yourself at age 15. What would you tell them about what you've learned? This can help process past experiences.",
  "category": "reflection"
}

{
  "title": "Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique",
  "description": "Next time you feel anxious, try this: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. We talked about grounding—this is a practical way to try it.",
